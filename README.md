## 📦 Getting Started

1. Local Setup

Since the project is built as a portable tool, you only need the single index.html file to run it.

2. Download the index.html file.

Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended).

3. Start coding!

## Project Structure

If you wish to modify the source, the project follows this internal architecture:

- Header: Logic for project naming, global actions, and the run engine.

- Main Stage: Flex container holding the editor-pane and preview-pane.

- Editor: Tabbed logic using textarea elements and hidden visibility states.

- Bridge Script: An injected IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that bridges the iframe console to the parent application terminal.

## ⌨️ Usage

- Switching Tabs: Click on HTML, CSS, or JS tabs to toggle the active editor.

- Running Code: If "Auto-Run" is enabled in preferences, your code updates 1 second after you stop typing. Otherwise, click the RUN CODE button in the header.

- Viewing Logs: Click the TERMINAL button in the preview bar to see JavaScript execution outputs.
